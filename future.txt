Some ideas for the future:

Currently, the track selection is done according to 2 attributes: track language and track name.
Let's add a 3rd attribute for subtitles only and call it something like "Verbosity". The value of this attribute for a given track is "How frequently
it appears on scrren relative to other tracks that weren't excluded yet" and will be divided to 3 actual values: Low, Medium and High. The benefit of
this is that it allows us to select "High" verbosity level on our track selection rules file and the program will be able to correctly select the
"dialoge" track among a number of *unnamed* tracks, since subtitle tracks that appear only for signs and songs are usually less verbose.

Stuff to think about before implementing:
- We need to parse all/few cluster and blocks (the external structure of the actual video/audio/subtitle data of the MKV) which might slow down
down the program significantly. 
- We need to deal with different subtitle codecs when we parse the block data. For example, blocks for subtitle tracks using the "S_TEXT/ASS" codec will
be located under "Cluster > Block group > Block", but blocks for subtitles tracks using the "S_HDMV/PGS" will be, like all other block, located under
"Cluster > Simple block", which requires us to parse more simple blocks for each cluster instead of looking for a "Block group > Block" with a matching
tracks number. More info about codecs in mkv: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-cellar-codec-01
- Need to come up with a way to ditinguish between subtitle tracks that are subbing *commentary* audio instead of the original audio, which might have the
same amount of verbosity.
